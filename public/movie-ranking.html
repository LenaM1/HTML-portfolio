<h1> BEST MOVIES WATCHED BY NEKESA</h1>
<h2> My Top Three movies of all times</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Come What May</h3>
<p>I enjoyed watching this movie as it helped in seeing the impact of homeschooling in a life of a young Christian boy.
    However, the video production done was a bit poor but the movie itself is great
</p>
<h3>Space X</h3>
<p>Watched it late but absolutely commendable work. General Ali made my best character and Doctor Chan.</p>
<h3>Overcomer</h3>
<p>Hannach Scott absolutely played out the character and this is a must watch for a christian.<br />
    The movie puts it to play the book of Ephesians merging the two concepts orthordoxy and othorpraxy</p>
